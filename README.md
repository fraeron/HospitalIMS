# HospitalIMS
A beginner C# console app of a Hospital Information Management System (IMS) for a fictional hospital named Pedro's Grace.

## To Do
- [x] Added local Swagger API.
- [x] Added compatibility to connect to a database hosted in a cloud server (Azure).
- [x] Added MailTrap API and configuration file for username and password of MailTrap API.
- [x] Added "Schedule an Appointment for a Patient" for Doctor Menu only.
- [x] Added a localhost website to showcase Swagger and third-party APIs.
- [x] Added third-party APIs using JavaScript.

## Added APIs
- [X] Coronavirus Tracker (Dashboard)
- [X] Cataas (Home)


## Database
The database (PedroHospital.bak) can be imported to MS SQL to demo the program's vanilla experience.

# Notes
- Tried to add MailTrap via plain JavaScript. Unfortunately not possible as Node.js is needed.
